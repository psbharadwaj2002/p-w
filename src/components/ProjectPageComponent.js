              ShopEase is a full-stack e-commerce platform that I built to
              showcase my skills. For the look and feel, I used React and React
              Bootstrap, making it user-friendly. On the backend, I used
              Express.js and MongoDB, which helped in managing data smoothly. To
              keep things secure, I added JWT authentication to make sure only
              the right people access it. And for extra security, I used bcrypt
              to keep sensitive information safe. This project not only shows
              what I can do but also how I make sure things are safe and easy
              for users.

              Developed a comprehensive Log Ingestor and Query Interface system,
              with the Log Ingestor serving as the backend for adding data
              through the "/api/ingestLogs" endpoint. This functionality enables
              users to input single or multiple logs via tools like Postman,
              with the data seamlessly stored in a MongoDB database.
              Additionally, the system incorporates a "/api/getLogs" endpoint
              for retrieving data. On the frontend, the Query Interface, built
              using ReactJS, facilitates intuitive data querying and
              visualization. This interface includes a robust search
              functionality, empowering users to retrieve specific information
              from the stored logs. The seamless integration of the Log Ingestor
              and Query Interface provides a cohesive and efficient solution for
              both log ingestion and data retrieval processes.
